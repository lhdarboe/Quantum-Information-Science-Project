# Quantum-Information-Science-Project
GKP states is a specific class of complex quantum states that can be used as "continuous-variable qubits". Using QuTiP the projects aim to simulate these protocols in detail

This module implements two-step cat breeding toward approximate GKP states using beamsplitters, squeezed cats, and conditional measurements.
The procedure attempts to map an initial encoded logical state toward the next logical GKP state (e.g., biasing a $|0\rangle_{gkp}$ toward $|1\rangle_{gkp}$, depending on the measurement outcomes $p_1, p_2$.
