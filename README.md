# Quantum-Information-Science-Project
GKP states is a specific class of complex quantum states that can be used as "continuous-variable qubits". Using QuTiP the projects aim to simulate these protocols in detail. This branch includes the creation and visualization of GKP states from a GKP state breeding circuit using measurements with projection onto the p-quadrature eigenstate for two different ways of creating the eigenstate. The work follows the article https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06193.
